## Claire family website

### Purpose
---
1. Serve as safe personal blogging space for each individual family member.
2. Showcase our adventures.
3. Allow extended family to see what we are up to.

### Dual functionality
---
The inspiration for this project was born from the disappointment with modern social media. We all felt as though social media such as instagram and twitter fostered a net negative experience on the whole. To challenge this, we decided to fabricate our own space where our views and opinions could be expressed freely without others feeling obligated to give their unwanted commentary. This project will have dual functionality in the respect that it will offer us a space free of negativity issued by others, as well as showcase our personal experiences and growth.

### Implementation
---
* The front end is created using HTML to provide the content, and CSS to style to our liking. Javascript is used to provide smooth user experience and increased interactivity on each page.

* Our backend is composed from a flask application built with python. It will utilize a postgreSQL database to store and retrieve information.

### Status
---
This project is still in the early stages of development and will be undergoing a lot of changes in the near future. It is not deployment ready at this time!
